AboutAbout
üëãüèΩ Hi, I'm Jessie

üåá Driven Data Scientist passionate about transforming complex data into tangible business value and building practical ML solutions. My journey from a top-percentile bootcamp scholar to data roles in dynamic startups reflects my proactive agency and commitment to continuous learning.

üìä With proven experience architecting and deploying impactful models (like XGBoost on Kubernetes at Reby, driving significant cloud cost savings) and establishing data foundations from scratch (at Bolttech), I thrive on tackling challenges across the data lifecycle. After honing my skills in fast-paced environments, I took a planned 1.5-year sabbatical for global exploration and independent projects, including co-founding Kamaji.co to develop an LLM-powered e-commerce experience.

üöÄ My expertise spans Python, SQL, MLOps practices, and major cloud platforms (GCP/AWS). I excel at delivering end-to-end projects, from data exploration and modeling to deploying scalable solutions and communicating insights effectively to diverse stakeholders. Known for meticulous attention to detail and taking ownership to drive results.

üí™üèΩ Technologies: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Flask, FastAPI, PyTorch), SQL, Git, Machine Learning (ML - Supervised/Unsupervised, XGBoost), Deep Learning (TensorFlow), NLP, LLMs, Generative AI, Statistics, A/B Testing, Google Cloud Platform (GCP - Vertex AI, Cloud Run, BigQuery), AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, MLFlow, Data Modeling, BI & Visualization (Sisense, Looker Studio, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

üé∂ When not diving into data, you can find me playing piano, training for triathlons, sailing, or practicing BJJ.
